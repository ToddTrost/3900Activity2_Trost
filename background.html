                        (Image: man furthest to the right) I've been active duty in the United States Air Force for almost a
                        decade. Of that decade, 5 years have been spent doing meteorology in the form of airfield
                        forecasting, aviation hazard briefings, and upper-low atmospheric analysis. The last 5 years have
                        been entirely focused on space weather. Within that timeframe, I've completed dozens of space
                        weather and Air Force space related courses, programs, and conferences. Accomplishing thousands
                        of hours of OJT has led to my long stint as a team lead, shift supervisor, leading training for
                        young Airmen, and revising/built hundreds of OJT training requirements alongside developing
                        new positional certification checklists.
